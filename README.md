# QR Attendance Tracker

This is a simple web application made to mark attendance using QR codes.

The app uses the device camera to scan a QR code, extracts participant details from it, and marks the participant as present. If the same QR code is scanned again, the app detects it as a duplicate and shows a warning message.

This project was built as part of a student task to understand basic JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and QR code scanning.
